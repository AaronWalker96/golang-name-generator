# Golang Name Generator

Ever wanted to generate a random word using code? Great!
Then the golang name generator is for you!

This project is based on a similar project I created,
written in Python. I'm rebuilding this project to help
me learn Golang.

## Running the Project

A `docker-compose.yml` file has been provided which can be run with `docker-compose up` where the api can be accessed on `localhost:8080`. Generated words are provided on the `generate` endpoint.
