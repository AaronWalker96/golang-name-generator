# Golang Name Generator

Ever wanted to generate a random word using code? Great!
Then the golang name generator is for you!

This project is based on a similar project I created,
written in Python. I'm rebuilding this project to help
me learn Golang.

## Running the Project

The api can be started by running the command `go run main.go`
where access will be available at `localhost:8080`. You can
get a generated word by making a call to the `/generate`
endpoint.
